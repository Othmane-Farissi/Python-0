# Hello.py

In this Exercice the main goal is to get familiar with all of : list , Tuple , Set , Dict :

## 1. List :

Definition: A list is an ordered, mutable (changeable), and indexed collection of elements. It allows duplicate elements, and it's defined using square brackets .

Example : my_list = [1, "2", "hello", 3.14]

## 2. Tuple :

Definition: A tuple is an ordered, immutable (unchangeable), and indexed collection of elements. It allows duplicate elements. It's syntax defined using parentheses .

Example: my_tuple = (1, 2, "world", 8.8)

## 3. Set :

Definition: A set is an unordered, mutable collection of unique elements, defined curly braces . 

Example: my_set = {1, 2, 3, "hello"}

## 4. Dict :

Definition: A dictionary is an unordered ,utable collection of key-value pairs. keys must be unique and immutable ,defined using curly braces {} with key-value pairs separated by colons :

Example: my_dict = {"name": "Othmane", "age": 25, "city": "Benguerir"}
