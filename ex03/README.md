# NULL Not Found

In Python, None is the equivalent of "Null" in other languages. However, there are other "null-like" values, such as:

None

False (boolean)

0 (integer)

0.0 (float)

'' (empty string)

[] (empty list)

{} (empty dictionary)

() (empty tuple)

set() (empty set)

Your function should check for these "null-like" values and print their types.

Return Values:

The function should return 0 if it finds a "null-like" value and prints its type.

It should return 1 if no "null-like" value is found.
